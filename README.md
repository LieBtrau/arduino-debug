Arduino debug library
============

Description
-----------

A dead-simple couple of debugging routines. Just needed a place
to put them.

Usage
-----

Drop the contents of the repository into a folder in your sketchbook
libraries called "debug". Debugging and/or logging can be disabled
by defining NDEBUG and NLOG in your source code.
